# ReactJS-MPA
This is using ReactJS components and JSX to dynamically render HTML pages while not limiting the application to a single HTML-file. This simple library was assembled by me for fun to use with another project where I wanted to use ReactJS with multiple HTML-files. My ReactJS and Javascript knowledge is somewhat limited, which means that you shall use this library at your own risk. Feel free to perform pull requests, create issues, etc.

## Setup new project

**Requirements:**
- NPM installed.
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Live Server *Visual Studio Code Extension* (recommended)

1. Download the library.
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
4. Install dependencies for JSX compilation by typing ```npm run install-dep```.
5. Start the JSX compiler by typing ```npm start```. (This will continue running until stopped and is required to run each time you work on your project)
6. Navigate to **/build/index.html** and start Live Server by clicking **Go Live** in the bottom right.
